# Fashion MNIST Neural Network

Things we've tried:
-Standard backprop
-Lateral inhibition preprocessing

Things we're trying:
-Convolutional (maybe not the best result, bc all images same size and resolution but trying it)

Things we cannot use:
-LQV, we don't have subclass combinations for this
-Kohonen, it's not unsupervised
