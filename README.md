# Fashion MNIST Neural Network

Things we've tried:
-Standard backprop
-Lateral inhibition preprocessing

Things we'r trying:
-tansig instead of logsig

Things we're putting on hold:
-Convolutional (maybe not the best result, bc all images same size and resolution)

Things we cannot use:
-LQV, we don't have subclass combinations for this
-Kohonen, it's not unsupervised
